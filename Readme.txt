What the code does:
In this code i have completed 3 different tasks that was required for the assignment. I was asked to build a software system that was able 
to proccess a text file and then visualise the results. The code also adds numbers to the text file as well as showing the range and mean 
of the set of numbers that are within the text file. These options are all able to be selected from a menu system that i have created within my code.

How to use the code:
Once the code has been run, a menu system will be printed on the screen. It requires a user input of a number, either 1, 2 or 3 in order to nagivate throughout 
the menu system and the rest of the code. Depending on the user input a different feature will be printed on the screen.

Future Improvements: 
The main suggestion i would have to improve this code is to be able to select certain numbers from the text file and then find the range and mean 
of them numbers only. I think this would be a huge development for this code as it allows the user to be able to select a range of numbers within the text file, but not 
all of them, in order to find the range and mean of them.

Another suggestion i would make to improve this code is to have an extra menu option that enables a new text file to be created and then be able to add numbers to 
that file. Aswell as being able to print the contents of the text file on the screen depending on what numbers the user has inputted.
